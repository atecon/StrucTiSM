Dear Sven,
I attach the following files for the UCM with regressors example we discussed:

- ita_load_h8_2021_2015.xslx    the data file with the following variables:
DATE date of daily data
H08 electric load (demand) for Italy at 8 in the moring
TEMP_MI average daily temperature in Milan
TEMP_RM average daily temperature in Rome
HOLIDAY holiday dummy
DayOfWeek number of day in the week (1=Mon, ...., 7=Sun)
OVER18_MI = max(0, TEMP_MI - 18)
UNDER18_MI = max(0, 18 - TEMP_MI)
OVER18_RM = max(0, TEMP_RM - 18)
UNDER18_RM = max(0, 18 - TEMP_RM)
TIME time index
cos1    cos2    cos3    cos4    cos5 cos6    cos7    cos8    cos9    cos10    cos11    cos12 cos13    cos14    cos15    cos16
sin1    sin2    sin3    sin4    sin5 sin6    sin7    sin8    sin9    sin10    sin11    sin12 sin13    sin14    sin15    sin16
cosines and sines of the time index at frequencies 2*pi/365 * j with j = 1, ..., 16

- ucm_example.sas: text file with SAS code to estimate an UCM with
dependent variable: H08
components: random walk (level), trigonometric seasonal component with period 7 days, irregular component
regressors: HOLIDAY UNDER18_MI OVER18_MI COS1-COS16 SIN1-SIN16
estimation sample: whole sample excluding last 28 days
forecast: last 28 days not used for estimation)

- ucm_example.pdf: estimation output as pdf

- output.xlsx: output as Excel file (much richer).

If you need more information or output just let me know.

Best,
Matteo
