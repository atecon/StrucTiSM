# StrucTiSM
This package implements Harvey-style structural time series models. The classical obligatory refrence is Harvey (1989), but more modern excellent treatments abound, such as Commandeur and Koopeman (2007) and Pelagatti (2015).

At presen, the package is rather limited (single-series only, no cycles) but we believe, useful for standrd tasks.
